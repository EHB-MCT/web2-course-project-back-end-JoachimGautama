# Spell Sheet

An API that keeps track of your spells and spell slots.

[spellsheet live on Render](https://spellsheet.onrender.com)

## Up & running (optional) 🏃‍➡️

Server spins down after a while. When down, it takes about a minute to spin back up.

I recommend checking the status or waking up the server by clicking the live on render link above.

## Sources 🗃️

List **ALL your used sources** here:

- Used a tutorial or example code? Place a link to them here. (youtube, website, github, ...) and **list the files in which they were used**.

It's not enough to only list the sources here, also add the sources to the top of the files in which you used them and indicate the specific parts of the code which are not your own (by writing comments and refering to the correct source(s)). \
IF you use a source as the base/start for a file, then first place the source in the file and **COMMIT it IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE** adding your own code or modifying it. \
**ALWAYS** use concise BUT CLEAR commit messages!
